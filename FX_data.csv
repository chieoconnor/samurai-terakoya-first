"THIRD PARTY DATA NOTICES "

"INTERACTIVE DATA PRICING AND REFERENCE DATA, LLC "

"In the event that licensee at any time receives index data from Interactive "
"Data Pricing and Reference Data, LLC ('IDC') containing evaluations, rather "
"than market quotations, for certain securities or certain other data "
"related to such securities, the following provisions shall also apply: "
""

"(a) Evaluated securities are typically complicated financial instruments. "
"There are many methodologies (including computer-based analytical modeling "
"and individual security evaluations) available to generate approximations of "
"the market value of such securities, and there is significant professional "
"disagreement about which is best. No evaluation method, including those "
"used by IDC, may consistently generate approximations that correspond to "
"actual 'traded' prices of the instruments; (b) IDC's methodologies used "
"to provide the pricing portion of certain index data may rely on "
"evaluations; however, licensee acknowledges that there may be errors "
"or defects in IDC's software, databases, or methodologies that may "
"cause resultant evaluations to be inappropriate for use in certain applications; "
"and (c) licensee assumes all responsibility for edit checking, external "
"verification of evaluations, and ultimately the appropriateness of "
"use of evaluations and other pricing data provided by IDC via the "
"index data in licensee's applications, regardless of any efforts made "
"by IDC in this respect. Licensee shall indemnify and hold IDC completely "
"harmless in the event that errors, defects, or inappropriate evaluations "
"are made available via the index data. IDC shall not be liable for "
"any claim that arose more than one year prior to the institution of "
"suit therefor. "
